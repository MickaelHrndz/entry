Animate a widget in

## Getting Started

This package lets you simply animate a widget into a visible state.
To do so, you only have to wrap it with an Entry widget.
The default constructor animates opacity, scale and position.
You can specify the delay, duration and curve of the animation.

There are three named constructors to Entry :
• Entry.fade() : animates opacity only
• Entry.grow() : animates scale only
• Entry.move() : animates position only
